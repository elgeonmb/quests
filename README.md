# Quest Set Builder

All information on arcs and quests derives from Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine (specifically the core rulebook, the Glass-Maker's Dragon campaign, and the Fortitude: By the Docks of Big Lake supplement), and from Dr. Jenna Moran's blog posts on the development of the game. I don't own any of the characters or concepts. 
I have no intention of digitizing the quest cards or quest goals themselves; this is meant to be a supplement to the game materials, not a replacement. Digital and physical versions of the quest cards are available for purchase on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/135389/Chuubos-Marvelous-WishGranting-Engine-Quest-Cards?manufacturers_id=4195">DriveThruRPG</a>
